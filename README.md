This repository contains projects that was done in first 3 weeks at makers academy.
Folder Learn-ruby-the-hard-way contains my learning process of Ruby.
Were introduced Ruby classes: Numeric, Integer, Float, String, Array, Hash, File, ARGF and many others. Also in order to write more complex programs I have learned loops, conditions, statements .. writing own methods (defs)
Tools: Ruby 2.0

Second week at makers was really challenging we've build program 

File: anagramma.rb
Challenge: To write a program which shows are the given words can produce an anagram (the result of rearranging the letter of a word to produce a new word)
Example: rats – star
Tools: Ruby 2.0 and Rspec
 
fizzbuzz.rb test.rb, test_t.rb (different implementations)
Challenge: To write a program that shows given numbers could be divided by 15 if yes then instead of number write FizzBuzz, divided by 5 (write Buzz) and divided by 3 (write Fizz).
Example: Number 15 -FizzBuzz
Number 5 -Buzz
Number 3 -Fizz.
I was able to improve my coding technique.
Writing more efficient code with Test Driven Development technique, was used Rspec, examples could be found in spec folder.
I also had my code notes also could be found here.
Tools: Ruby 2.0 and Rspec

Boriss bike app
Challenge: Implementing app which helps to control usage of bikes to residents of the city.
