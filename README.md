First_3_weeks_at_makers
=======================

<p>This repository contains projects that was done in first 3 weeks at makers academy</p>
Folder <a href="https://github.com/violentr/First_3_weeks_at_makers/tree/master/Learn-the-ruby-hard-way-week1"><b>Learn-ruby-the-hard-way</b></a> contains my learning process of Ruby.
Were introduced Ruby classes:
 <ul><li>Numeric</li>
 <li>Integer</li>
 <li>Float</li>
 <li>String</li>
 <li>Array</li>
 <li>Hash</li>
 <li>File</li>
 <li>ARGF</li>
 <li> and others</li>
 </ul>
 <p>Also in order to write more complex programs I have learned loops, conditions, statements .. writing own methods (defs)</p>
<b>Tools:</b> Ruby 2.0

<a href="https://github.com/violentr/First_3_weeks_at_makers/tree/master/week2"><b>Second week at makers</b></a> was really challenging we've build programs: 

<b>Filename:</b> anagramma.rb</br>
<b>Challenge:</b> To write a program which shows are the given words can produce an anagram (the result of rearranging the letter of a word to produce a new word)
<b>Example:</b> "rats" in refverse is "star"
<b>Tools:</b> Ruby 2.0 and Rspec
 
<b>Filename:</b> fizzbuzz.rb test.rb, test_t.rb (different implementations)</br>
<b>Challenge:</b> To write a program that shows given numbers could be divided by 15 if yes then instead of number write <b>FizzBuzz</b>, divided by 5 (write <b>Buzz</b>) and divided by 3 (write <b>Fizz</b>).
<ul>
<li>Example: Number 15 - FizzBuzz</li>
<li>Number 5 -Buzz</li>
<li>Number 3 -Fizz</li>
</ul>
<p>I was able to improve my coding technique.
Writing more efficient code with Test Driven Development technique, was used Rspec, examples could be found in spec folder.I also had my code notes also could be found <a href="https://github.com/violentr/First_3_weeks_at_makers/tree/master/week2">here.</a></p>
<b>Tools:</b> Ruby 2.0 and Rspec

<a href="https://github.com/violentr/First_3_weeks_at_makers/tree/master/boriss-bike-app"><b>Boriss bike app</b></a></br>
<b>Challenge:</b>Implementing app which helps to control usage of bikes to residents of the city.
<b>Tools:</b> Ruby 2.0 and test framework Rspec
<p>Were introduced Mocks and Stubs testing with (double) techniques (spec folder)</p>

<a href="https://github.com/violentr/First_3_weeks_at_makers/tree/master/Friday-Test-Airport-App"><b>Friday Test Airport App</b></a></br>
<b>Challenge:</b> Write a program what helps to perform following tasks:
<ul>
<li>Coordinate plane operations based on whether forecast and trigger different operations based on the forecast.</li>
<li>Make full control over amount of planes coming and leaving from the airports and make sure that enough space & resource is available to keep planes over night.</li>
<li>Control over airport runway, asking and receiving permissions of actions that may be taken.</li>
<li>Program Bomb Scare, where operations are restricted and system to call it of, so operations may return to normal.</li>
</ul>
<b>Tools:</b> Ruby 2.0 and Rspec
